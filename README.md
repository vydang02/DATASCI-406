# DATASCI-406: Computational Methods
Computation is the beating heart of modern statistics. Large data sets, complex models, and novel
data collection methods all necessarily require heavy computation, but computation also allows
applications of elegant theories that defy pen and paper solutions. In this course, we will explore the
complementary relationship of theory and application provided by modern computational tools and
techniques using the R programming language.
